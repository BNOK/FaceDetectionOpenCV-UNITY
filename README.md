Creating a .dll file in C++ that detects faces based on functionalities from OpenCV
Exporting the file and importing it to a unity project 
using the file to detect the face, take the face position output and using it to move an object just like the face 
making a mirror that mirrors the moving object, all the coding in unity was in C#
